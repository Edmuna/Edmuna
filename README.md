- 👋 Hi, I’m @Edmuna SA, which is an acronym of the names of some people that I love, a self taught beginner programmer. Last year, around in October I started discovering the world of programming languages.
- It took me some time to try and understand what is going on in this completely unknown world to me so far. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... anything that's interesting, beneficial and potentially profitable. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... currently focusing on front-end development technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... projects and collaborations with anyone. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... either here or check my webpage www.edinhamzic.com
