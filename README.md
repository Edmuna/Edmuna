- 👋 Hi, I’m @Edmuna SA, which is an acronym of the names of some people that I love, a self taught beginner programmer. Last year, around in October I started discovering the world of programming languages.
- It took me some time to try and understand what is going on in this completely unknows world to me so far. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... anything that's interesting, beneficial and profitable. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... mostly technologies connected to front-end development currently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... everything with everyone. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... either here or check my webpage www.edinhamzic.com
